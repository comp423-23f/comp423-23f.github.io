        <div id="content" class="content col-xl-9 col-lg-9 order-2 order-lg-1 pt-3"><p>For the final project, your team will choose a feature of the Computer Science Experience Labs’ web application to focus on implementing well to serve the UNC Computer Science population. Part of your task is designing the user experience around this feature, with design and technical specification documents. Therefore, the descriptions of each project is intentionally high level and goal-oriented.</p>
<h2 id="expected-level-of-difficulty">Expected Level of Difficulty</h2>
<p>The following projects ideas are of similar scope and organized, roughly, by expected level of difficulty to complete.</p>
<h3 id="extending-a-drop-in-reservation-for-more-time">Extending a Drop-in Reservation for More Time</h3>
<p>Context: Drop-in reservations are currently limited to 2-hour periods. When a drop-in reservation’s end time is within the next 30 minutes, another student is able to claim the next turn on the seat by creating a drop-in reservation that starts between 1 and 30 minutes into the future.</p>
<p>With the given context, as Sally Student, I would like to be able to add an additional 1-hour extension to my drop-in seat reservation when no other student has created a drop-in reservation immediately following mine. I should only have this option if it truly exists, otherwise I should see some indication that my reservation will end in X minutes and the drop-in reservation cannot be extended because another student is waiting for the seat.</p>
<h3 id="modifying-the-assigned-seat-of-drop-in-reservations">Modifying the Assigned Seat of Drop-in Reservations</h3>
<p>Context: In the future, some portion of the seats with monitors, both sitting and standing, will be pre-reservable. Imagine half are. Once this is the case, all seats will be labeled with an index (like Seat 00, Seat 01, Seat 02) and physically labelled in the room. When a pre-reservation is made, it will be for a specific desk. Additionally, when a drop-in reservation is made a specific seat will be assigned. First the seats that are not pre-reservable will be assigned, then the seats that are reservable but do not have an upcoming reservation will be assigned. When a drop-in begins, it will be assigned a specific seat visible from the “Confirm Reservation Details” screen. This assignment logic is already implemented, waiting for you, and not part of this project. However, since no desks are currently pre-reservable and we do not have this feature for changing seats implemented, we advertise all seats as part of a pool and do not label seats specifically in production. Your feature will change this!</p>
<p>With the given context, as Sally Student, I would like to have the option to choose a different available seat on the “Confirm Reservation Details” draft screen, the reservation confirmed screen, and the checked-in / active reservation screens. I should have confidence that if I cange my seat to a pre-reserved seat I know whether there is a reservation that will cut my drop-in reservation shorter than expected. As a stretch goal, I would like to have a visual representation of where my assigned seat is and where I am changing it to.</p>
<h3 id="seat-and-room-administration-views">Seat and Room Administration Views</h3>
<p>As Amy Ambassador or Rhonda Root, I need to be able to manage the rooms and, where applicable, such as the XL Co-lab in SN156, the seats in each room along with their features. Currently, these entities exist and data is prepopulated into the system via a script, but there is no user interface for listing, adding, editing, and deleting rooms and seats for XL administrators.</p>
<h3 id="group-reservations">Group Reservations</h3>
<p>As Sally Student, I want to drop-in to the XL with my project team and would like to be able to add my team members to a drop-in reservation’s confirmation page so that they do not have to create their own drop-in reservations. Amy Ambassador needs to be able to check us in as a group. Additionally, I should have confidence that there are enough seats available in the given seat type to make this group reservation. If insufficient seating is available, I should not be able to make the reservation.</p>
<h3 id="xl-friendship-system">XL Friendship System</h3>
<p>As Sally Student, I want to be able to request friendship with specific peers in the CS program. Once my friends accept the friendship request, when I view the Coworking Status, I should be able to see which of my friends are checked into the XL, if any, and the seats they are sitting at. As a stretch goal, in conjunction with the previous project idea “Multiple-user/Multiple-seat Reservations”, friends should be easy and convient to add to a reservation draft.</p>
<h3 id="seat-prereservations-reservable-seats">Seat Prereservations (Reservable Seats)</h3>
<p>Context: Once this feature is implemented, some percentage of the XL seats (likely 50%) will be pre-reservable up to one week in advance while others remain drop-in only. Desks that are not pre-reserved for the next 1-hour will become available for drop-in to maximize utilization of the XL seating.</p>
<p>As Sally Student, I need to be able to pre-reserve a seat in the XL for a specific time and date that the XL is open and the seat is available. Additionally, I need to see my future reservations and be limited to a number of reservations as defined in the Coworking PolicyService.</p>
<h3 id="student-organization-member-management-system">Student Organization Member Management &amp; System</h3>
<p>As Larry Club Leader, I need to be able to join my student organization as an administrator. As Sally Student, I need to be able to request to join a student organization. As a member, I should be able to see all club events, including members-only events. As a club leader, I should be able to edit a club’s information, manage its event list, accept membership requests, and manage the club membership list.</p>
<h2 id="high-difficulty">High Difficulty</h2>
<h3 id="coworking-policy-management-and-enforcement">Coworking Policy Management and Enforcement</h3>
<p>Context: Currently, there is a single policy that dictates limitations around drop-in reservations such as how long the initial duration is, how far out into the future you can reserve a drop-in, the minimum amount of time a drop-in can be for when the XL approaches its closing hour, and so on. Once pre-reservations are available, These hard-coded limits are implemented in <code>backend/services/coworking/policy.py</code></p>
<p>As Rhonda Root, I need to be able to create, edit, and otherwise manage custom Coworking Policies. Additionally, I need to be able to add users to a specific policy, such as policies for XL Ambassadors, Club Leaders, COMP Course UTAs, and so on, who may be given additional time to pre-reserve meeting rooms or reservable desks, for example. These policy changes should impact the front-end user experience, such as how long a draft drop-in reservation is valid for before expiring, or how far into the future you can search for a pre-reservation.</p>
<h3 id="xl-wide-coworking-reservation-statistics">XL-wide Coworking Reservation Statistics</h3>
<p>As Amy XL Ambassador or Rhonda Root, I need to be able to see past reservation statistics to better understand demand and usage. I need to be able to view data over dynamic date ranges, compare usage over two time periods, and any other useful analysis and visualization. I need to be able to save the parameters of common queries called “Reports” that can be opened without having to specify the parameters again. As a stretch goal, I would like to be able to make some reports or visualizations publicly viewable for display on information screens or for sharing. Another stretch goal would be giving Sally Student the ability to view their own individualized coworking statistical history.</p>
<h3 id="room-reservations-system">Room Reservations System</h3>
<p>Context: In the Spring, most of the rooms along the back hallway of Sitterson Hall’s first floor will be reservable for group projects, group study, and more. These rooms will undergo rennovation with new carpet, paint, and furniture over winter break.</p>
<p>As Sally Student, I need to be able to make a reservation for a group of peers (added to the reservation) and an appropriately sized room that is available when I am searching for. If multiple room options exist during desired time range, I should be able to choose which room I’d like. The experience of finding an available room for my group should be delightfully pleasant to use.</p>
<h3 id="equipment-reservation-system-e.g.-quest-3s">Equipment Reservation System (e.g. Quest 3s)</h3>
<p>Context: In the Spring, the XL will have 18 Quest 3 Virtual/Mixed-Reality Headsets available for multi-day and weekend checkout. Looking further ahead, we would like to have a library of equipment available for checkout, with some ideas including: iPads, iPhones, Androids, Mac Studios, Keyboards, Arduinos, and so on.</p>
<p>As Sally Student, I need to be able to see what resources are available and request a reservation of an available unit. Additionally, I need to digitally sign a usage and liability agreement in the event of losing or carelessly breaking a piece of equipment, in advance of my first checkout.</p>
<p>As Amy Ambassador, I need to be able to confirm a resource was checked out by the student who requested it. Upon return, I need to be able to check the resource checked back in. Each resource of the same type should have its own unique identifier for individualized tracking of which student has which resource.</p>
